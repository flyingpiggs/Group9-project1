# Function purpose:
#	Note: Dictionary is referring to the python dictionary, not a dictionary we look up words in. Also, list will refer
#		to the programming list since python doesn't technically have arrays. 

#	This function is meant to read in information about the faults, then produce a dictionary that will have the necessary 
#	information we need during the circuit simulation to override the good circuit. The keys into this dictionary should 
#	correspond to the wire that is used to identify nodes in the circuit simulation.

#	Each member of this list will be its own dictionary with the following key/value pairings:
#	value : whatever value this fault will be stuck at, will be '0' or '1'
#	terminal : refers to the input wire of a logic gate, will be a string of some sort
#	Note: The wires in the given code follow the format "wire_NAME" where NAME is whatever it was in the benchmark file
#	wire: This is used to access the specific node in the circuit that we're interested in 

# Parameters: 
# 1.  faultInfo
#	A text file that lists the faults that will be present in the circuit simulation

#	Note: There's an assumption that the faults in this list will be actual wires in the associated benchmark file
#	i.e. I'm not going to bother doing any input sanitation, nor should there be comments or anything like that in the fault file.
#	Lastly, the expected format for faults in this text file will be something similar to as follows:
#		If just a wire is faulty, then it should be something like "A-SA-0"
#		If the input to a gate is fault, then if the output wire is called K and input wire is called g, 
#		then the fault should appear as "K-IN-g-SA-0"

# Returns: faults, a list of faults
